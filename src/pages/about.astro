          Monadic DNA is building a privacy-preserving platform for genomic data storage, analysis, and sharing. We believe that individuals should have complete control over their most personal information while still benefiting from the power of genomic analysis and research.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          By leveraging cutting-edge cryptographic techniques including homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs, we enable genomic analysis without compromising privacy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-unbounded text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-12">Our Technology</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Homomorphic Encryption</strong> — Perform computations on encrypted genomic data without ever decrypting it, ensuring your raw DNA sequence never leaves your control.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</strong> — Verify properties about your genomic data without revealing the data itself, enabling privacy-preserving authentication and validation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Secure Enclaves</strong> — Hardware-based security that creates isolated execution environments for sensitive computations on your genomic data.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Decentralized Storage</strong> — Distribute encrypted genomic data across multiple locations, eliminating single points of failure and reducing breach risks.
